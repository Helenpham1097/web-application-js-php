            <ul>
                <li><i>What special features you have done or attempted in creating the website?</i>
                    <br>
                    I try to create a modern webpage, use a various HTML and CSS features as much as I can to create
                    lovely webpages,
                    create dynamic HTML page in PHP code. Using all the features of PHP in all the lessons until now.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><i> Which part do you have trouble with?</i>
                    <br>
                    I am not familiar with using PHP to write. When I did task 3 to insert to database, it showed me the
                    HTTP 500 error. Unlike other programming language such as Java
                    I cannot debug. Therefore, I had to separate every single function to test with the web page and
                    also the database. After figuring out, I did not tackle with any troubles.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><i>What would you like to do better next time? </i>
                    <br>
                    I would like to learn more about HTML and CSS to make the webpages more convenient and beautiful. Also, applying new feature of PHP to make my code clean.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><i>What you have learned along the way? Did you see any references or resources during this project?
                    If so, please include the sources.</i>
                    <br>
                    I learned how to deal with bugs, how to fix it fast and apply some HTML and CSS elements that I have
                    not known before.
                    <br>
                    I used <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3 Schools</a> website to search some functions
                </li>
